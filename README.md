# JojoDiff-js

A node.js wrapper of [JojoDiff](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jojodiff/) by Joris Heirbaut. For more information and to see the API, see the JojoDiff project page on SourceForge.

JojoDiff is great because it generates linear patch files, which can be applied in a very memory-efficient manner.

Make sure 'make' command is in your path (Linux, macOS, Cygwin under Windows) by running:
`make -v`
